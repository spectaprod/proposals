### Proposal - 2023 Q1 - Tim Munsell (spectaprod)

Internal budget proposal for Dash Incubator

### Background 

The [Incubator rules doc (v3)](https://github.com/dashincubator/dash-incubator-rules/blob/042fde0eea2340a2a8c9fa3483ad8f764d94fe31/rules.md) directs individual strategists to submit internal budget proposals to the Lead Strategist.

From the Rules document:

> 5.1.2 Strategist Proposals #
> Each Strategist submits quarterly proposals to the Lead Strategist to increase their budgets. The content and purpose of this proposal is similar to the Lead Strategistâ€™s Network Proposal. It should report project updates, value propositions, budget spending, quarterly priorities, and anything else the strategist wants to commmunicate in order to help justify the value delivered to the network for the funding received and requested.

### Project Updates & Budget Spending

My Q4 budget was 300 Dash, of which 199.8 was distributed in rewards across the following bounties:

* [Dashmate Bug Fixes, Improvements & Innovations](https://trello.com/c/11azWJXT) - This is an ongoing bounty to support ongoing development, improvements, fixes, etc. for Dashmate.
 * **Status:** ongoing
 * The bulk of Q4 activity was the beginning of a project to migrate dash-deploy to dashmate - this is ~25% complete.
 * Q1 2023 will see continued progress. There isn't a completion ETA.
* [Local Money](https://trello.com/c/fjdVR5U4) - This is a dash "onramp" designed to facilitate p2p Dash <> fiat exchanges providing the ability to seek, find, and execute trades.
 * **Status:** ~20% complete
 * In Q4 the MVP features, functions, and user flows were defined.
 * Q1 2023 will see UX development, and depending on timing, initial code deployment as well.
* [Read Investments Data from Blockchain](https://trello.com/c/nvmKHDR1) - This will create a public facing place users can quickly search and reference the history of proposals to MNOs. This will include light data manipulation capabilities and include csv download of project and funding daa for further local analysis.
 * **Status:** ~50% complete
 * In Q4 the progress toward complete was minimal consisting mostly of QA of and Spec work for next steps
 * Q1 2023 will see code development from UX design and the deployment of data extraction, manipulation, and visualization functionality.
 * The biggest risk/difficulty is and has been that the primary contributors are located in Ukraine
* [Dash Core Contributions](https://trello.com/c/dbkj327J) - this is an ongoing bounty that rewards Dash for merged PRs to the [Dash Core repo](https://github.com/dashpay/dash) on Github to any non-DCG developers. This bounty is administered by Pasta
 * **Status:** ongoing
 * In Q4 a couple medium sized PRs were awarded.
* [Goal/Challenge Platform](https://trello.com/c/8Hy6K7fE) - This is a dapp utilizing Platform smart contract capabilities to create bet-on-yourself games or challenges. Users can create, find, join, and complete games wagering Dash on their individual success.
 * **Status:** uncertain - development was recently restarted after the previous contributors withdrew from contributing to the incubator. Several components are now out of date with the current platform deployment.
 * In Q4 development was restarted and progress has been fixing elements that had fallen out of date
 * Q1 2023 should see new progress and depending on pace, completion of the MVP in late Q1 or Q2.
* [Interactive Dash Ecosystem Webpage](https://trello.com/c/djmlrMDC) - This was an inherited bounty, and is nearing completion. This is closely related to the infographic (above). It is the "presentation layer" presenting the infographic for easy display and navigation in a web browser across mulitple languages. You can see the infographic, available interactions, and hosting environment [here] (https://media.dash.org/wp-content/uploads/Dash-Ecosystem-English-4K-2022-05-11.jpg)
 * **Status:** unknown - I only just throught of adding this data, and don't have a response from the contributors yet about how complete this is.
 * In Q4 the was QA of local language options and Specification for a function that "enables the creation of direct links to a specific infographic. It allows dash.org (among others) to forward a visitor to a specific infographic in a preferred language".
 * Q1 2023 will see continued progress and development for the new functionality that was specified (in QA now)
* [Influencer Affiliate Site](https://trello.com/c/JZFZNNRr) - This was a concept I accepted on behalf of Ash and have since handed to him.
 * **Status:** handed off
* [Dash Incubator Getting Started](https://trello.com/c/Gc2vzB0E) - This ongoing bounty rewards various activities for introducing and onboarding new contributors.
 * **Status:** ongoing
 * In Q4 the contribution was a referred contributor.
 * This bount might need reveiwing. It is likely there are contribotor elligible for rewards and unaware. If that is the case do this incentives need to be continued, are they valuable incentives?
* [Dash Ecosystem Infographic](https://trello.com/c/L306RZDn) - This was an inherited bounty, and is nearing completion. This is a graphical representation of the entire Dash ecosystem for quick reference. Link to the current state is in below.
 * **Status:** ongoing as the ecosystem evolves
 * Q4 progress was the QA of local language updates (Russian)

My Q4 proposal also included the following bounties on which I didn't make any progress:

* [Atomic Swaps](https://trello.com/c/o9l91FLG) - This was help up because the contributor assigned to QA wasn't able to complete the work. A new contributor was  assigned but no work completed until Q1 2023. I expect development to continue through the rest of Q1
* [DashSee](https://trello.com/c/UALbkO5H) - Same as the above

### Quarterly Priorities & Value Propositions

During the upcoming quarter I expect to fund progress across most of the bounties I funded last quarter. I expect my top priorities will be:

* [Atomic Swaps](https://trello.com/c/o9l91FLG) - The MVP is near completion, needing some final QA and a functionality. The future state is uncertain, but my goals is get it across the line and decide "what next" later.
* [Goal/Challenge Platform](https://trello.com/c/8Hy6K7fE) - This MVP has more development, depending on pace I hope we can have a release by early Q2. I see this as a easy, socially shareable, means of introducing new user to Dash and even crypto in general.
* [Decentralized Dynamic Application Infrastructure](https://trello.com/c/q16cvr5A) - Same status as the above. I see tremendous opportunity with this bounty to give developers a quick means of building on Platform.
* [Dashmate Bug Fixes, Improvements & Innovations](https://trello.com/c/11azWJXT) - This caries the endorsement and priority from critical developers within the Dash ecosystem.
* [Platform Console](https://trello.com/c/Xezls3IC) - This bounty was original to dashameter and has been picked back up by emmanualeclipse. It is to create a Dash Platform wallet, identity, username, contract, and document all from a web browser with no coding required

### Budget Request

I am requesting 100 DASH/month for 3 months.  This will cover most of the budget to fund the projects I'm administering directly. Based on current unawarded claims, if this pace continues I will begin to draw from my reserve fund (currently stands at 494). This is data that will be considered for the next round of proposals.
